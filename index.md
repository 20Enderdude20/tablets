Below is the list of tablets which DIGImend project has information about.
Some of these are supported by the upstream Linux kernel, some are only
supported by
[digimend-kernel-drivers](https://github.com/DIGImend/digimend-kernel-drivers),
some are not supported at all, and support state of others is not known. This
is indicated in the "Status" column.

There are several companies (original equipment manufacturers -- OEMs)
designing and making graphics tablet hardware, although origins of their
designs can be traced to just one or two of them. There are many more companies
selling these tablets under their names, i.e. re-branding them.
